During program's running, after reading the header, he prints following header information:
nbin: 32768
nfft: 100 
nsub: 20 
mbin: 4096 
nchan: 8 
nsamp: 1638400 
nvalid: 16384

I would like to establish a correspondence between these identifiers and ours.

OURS:
mlenarr
m_n_p
mvalD_max
mvalf_min
mvalf_max
mvalSigmaBound


raw_signal - raw antenna voltage time series
ConversionConst
mlenChunk -length of chunk in time domain
m_lenarr - total length of seriesof samples in time domain (length of input signal)
m_n_p - length of the pulse in time bins, i.e (t_p/\tau), or N_p in the paper.

m_f_min, m_f_max - minimal and maximal frequency band of the signal.
            - signal is assumed to be base-band sampled
 
m_SigmaBound - The minimal statistical significane to trigger a saving of a result.

m_D_max - maximal dispersion to scan, in units of pc cm^-3
m_IMaxDT  - the maximal delay(in time bins) of the maximal dispersion.
